### Features

### Features left to implement

A future feature I would like to add, Improving the analytics report to show spending against the monthly budget and to be able to add recurring income/expenses that happen every month from specified dates. This would minimize the amount the user will have to interact with the app making it less of a task.

## Deployment and Local Development

### Deployment

This project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku.

The steps for deployment are:

    1. Create a new Heroku app with a unique name and the region

    2. In the "settings" tab, set the build packs to 'Python' and 'NodeJS' (the order is important)

    3. Link the Heroku app to the GitHub repository

    4. In case it is wished, enable "automatic deploys" to automatically update the app in case of a new commit

    5. Click on Deploy in the "manual deploy" area
